=============
Build Process
=============

Overview
--------

A full build processes typically have the following stages:

- initialization and configuration resolution,

- definition of tasks,

- running tasks:

  1. generate content as needed to prepare,

  2. run ``sphinx-build``,

  3. process the build and stage (typically to ``build/public/``,) and finally

- (optionally) deploy to production.

Initialization happens in :mod:`giza.cmdline` and uses :mod:`argh`, while
configuration happens in the the :mod:`giza.config` package. The
definition of tasks happens in the entry point functions
:mod:`giza.operations` package, often by calling definition functions
in the :mod:`giza.content` package, where near the procedures for
running tasks.

Implementation
--------------

The following procedure outlines the flow of control in a prototypical
build examples. The following procedure also highlights the
differences

1. The main ``giza`` entry point is the :func:`giza.cmdline.main()`
   function which using :mod:`argh` to assemble subsidiary entry
   points and dispatch control to other operations. Build operations
   have the following entry points:

   - If you use the *makefile emulation* mode, all commands enter
     through :mod:`giza.operations.make` which parses the a make-like
     target and then calls the appropriate ``giza``-functions
     internally and prints the corresponding "native" giza
     command. In common practice most invocations enter through this
     path, thinking about :mod:`giza.operations.make` as the "main
     entry" point is probably confusing.

   - :func:`giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.main()` is the entry point for
     all "plain" sphinx builds.

   - The "push" target, which builds a full documentation set before
     deploying the artifcats, (both ``make push`` or ``giza push -t
     <target>``) uses :func:`giza.operations.deploy.publish_and_deploy()`.

2. Regardless of entry point, ``giza`` collects a list of sphinx
   builders, as well as lists of editions and human language
   translations and invokes
   :func:`giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.sphinx_publication()`, which
   orchestrates the Sphinx preparation, running, and
   post-processing. Sphinx builders are:

   - ``publish``, which is a shortcut for the full collection of
     Sphinx builders defined in the``integration`` configuration file for the
     publication build. Typically this is: ``dirhtml`` (primary format,) ``html``
     (for tarball,)``epub``, ``singlehtml``, ``latex`` (for pdf,) and
     ``json`` (for search integration,) and

   - a valid Sphinx build target defined by the current sphinx builder

3. :func:`giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.sphinx_publication()` begins
   adding tasks for the build
   (i.e. :func:`giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.build_prep_tasks()`,) and
   then builds an iterator that yields an``(edition, language,
   builder)`` tuple for every combination in the current process, to
   begin adding the remainder of the build tasks.

4. **If** the :attr:`giza.config.paths.branch_source` has not already been
   created and processed, in
   :func:`~giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.sphinx_publication()` follows a
   branch that:

   - adds tasks to process the source and populate the
     :attr:`~giza.config.paths.branch_source` directory
     (:func:`giza.content.source.source_tasks()`),

   - generate content in the *proxy source* directory
     (:func:`giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.build_content_generation_tasks()`),

   - refresh the time stamps of source file
     :attr:`~giza.config.paths.branch_source` to reflect actual
     changes in content based on the implicit dependency graph between
     files (:func:`giza.content.dependencies.refresh_dependency_tasks()`
     and :func:`giza.content.dependencies.dump_file_hash_tasks()`),

   - to support generation of offset printing-compatible PDFs, migrate ``.eps``
     image files to the ``latex`` build directory
     (:func:`giza.content.source.latex_image_transfer_tasks()`),

5. Still in :func:`~giza.operations.sphinx_cmds.sphinx_publication()`
   add tasks to run Sphinx
   itself (:func:`giza.content.sphinx.sphinx_tasks()`).

6. Execute all tasks. Tasks run (essentially) in the order described
   above (order of addition,) though groups of tasks typically execute
   in parallel.

7. Process and print all output from sphinx
   (:func:`giza.content.sphinx.output_sphinx_stream()`,) normalizing
   paths and de-duplicating messages from multiple builds.

8. If executing from
   :func:`giza.operations.deploy.publish_and_deploy()` (i.e. as a
   "``push``") and the sphinx processes all executed with a zero-exit
   status, deploy the build as specified
   (:func:`giza.operations.deploy.deploy_worker()`). The specifics of
   the deploy operation are:

   - pull the deploy specification from the ``push.yaml`` file.

   - build deploy commands using :class:`giza.deploy.Deploy()`.

   - run deploy commands in the worker pool.

Discussion
----------

Content Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:mod:`giza` based sites prefer to generate content into static files
before running ``sphinx-build``. Manipulating content in the within
the Sphinx process is difficult because you have interact with content
in a DOM-like interface which is opaque difficult to introspect, and
there are limited opportunities for optimization within the Sphinx
process itself.

All content generation code is in the :mod:`giza.content` package, and
uses `rstcloth <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rstcloth/>`_ to generate
and write reStructuredText from Python.

The content generation process has the following stages:

- generate content that modifies the content of the ``source``
  directory, and generates all output that is not impacted by the
  output language, or edition. This includes most content
  generation tasks. (e.g. command line arguments, tables for function
  arguments, tables, the ``robots.txt`` file, downloading Intersphinx
  inventories, updating asset repositories, and updating time stamps
  for dependencies.)

- copy, using ``rsync --recursive --delete`` the contents  ``source/``
  to a directory in ``build/<branch>/source[...]`` that ``sphinx-build`` will use
  to build artifacts. Each combination of branch, edition, and
  language have their own source directory in ``build/``.

- generate content that depends on output language or
  edition. (e.g. redirects, examples, procedures, tables of contents,
  file migrations.) This happens *once* per combination of branch,
  edition, and language.

In most cases, generated content takes data defined in structured
``yaml`` files and produces restructured text using ``rstcloth``. A
common feature of these content generators is that they support strict
structures and content reuse with very fine-grained inheritance-based
controls.

In a group of related files, which each hold sequences of ``yaml``
documents, each document is identifiable by the combination of
file name and a special id (typically ``ref``). You can use this id to
refer to a "base" document, which the inheriting document can override
on a per-field basis.

The base implementation for inheritance is in :mod:`giza.core.inheritance`,
although there are some format-specific implementations in
:mod:`giza.content.examples.inheritance` and
:mod:`giza.content.steps.inheritance`.

The content generation implementations are largely legacy, except for
:mod:`~giza.content.steps` and :mod:`examples`. :mod:`~giza.content.steps`
and :mod:`examples`, use a MVC-inspired architecture that clearly
separate output format from the data representation or the inheritance
implementation. Eventually other content generators will use this
structure, as needed, but current implementations are stable and
sufficient.

Sphinx
------

The core of the build process is an invocation of
``sphinx-build``. :mod:`giza` will run multiple invocations of Sphinx
at the same time, as needed when building multiple versions of a
resource for multi-output (i.e. "edition") sites, to generate
publication artifacts or translation testing. A single ``giza`` can
build as many versions of a single resource as needed at one time.

Additional configuration for the sphinx build process is
in the ``sphinx_local`` configuration structure,
which is typically ``config/sphinx_local.yaml``, and accessible in the
``conf.system.files.data.sphinx_local`` in the configuration
object. Before a sphinx build starts
``conf.system.files.data.sphinx_local`` is processed into a per-build
``sconf`` object in the :func:`giza.operations.sphinx_publication()`
function.

The core function for running ``sphinx-build`` is
:func:`giza.content.sphinx.run_sphinx()` which assembles the command
line arguments for ``sphinx-build`` and runs the command before
handing the output of this command
:func:`giza.content.sphinx.output_sphinx_stream()` to process the
Sphinx output into more actionable items by removing duplicate output
and normalizing paths so that:

- parallel builds don't over-report errors.

- Sphinx's own parallelism don't over-report errors.

- Path names reflect the actual source directory rather than the
  working copy of the source directory in the ``build`` directory. The
  output also fully supports ``compile-mode`` in Emacs.

Finally :func:`giza.content.sphinx.run_sphinx()`, runs tasks defined
by :mod:`giza.content.sphinx.finalize_sphinx_build()`.

Post Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :mod:`giza.content.post` package for all post-processing
tasks. The post-processing tasks get called from
:mod:`giza.content.sphinx.finalize_sphinx_build()`, which only runs if
the ``sphinx-build`` command in
:mod:`giza.content.sphinx.run_sphinx()` returns without error.

.. As of 2014-10-28, giza finalizes all builds, even those that don't
   finish successfully.

Deploy
~~~~~~

Deploying completed builds to production happens by running a sequence
of ``rsync`` commands defined in the ``push`` configuration structure,
which is typically ``config/push.yaml``, or
``conf.system.files.data.push`` in the configuration
object. Translating the configuration
to ``rsync`` commands happens in the :mod:`giza.deploy` module,
although this implementation predates the current configuration
infrastructure, and is due for refactoring.
